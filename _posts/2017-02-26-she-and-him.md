If it were up to her, he would have been gone years ago. But she is a she (not a he) and she doesn't have the final say. He does. He who defended the other him for being a "damn good engineer." Despite the fact that he cannot control himself enough to avoid casually making factually inaccurate comments about a violent, sexual act in a very, very secluded area, where not a soul could overhear his little secret. Or at least, what he thought was his little secret. She reported it, nothing happened. He is still there and she is not.
