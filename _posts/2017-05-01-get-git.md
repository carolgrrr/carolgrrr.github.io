Git is a bit complicated, but with some practice you can totally get it. Practice is basically the only way I was able to get comfortable with git. It starts with a fetch, add, commit, push. Those are the basic commands. 

The beauty of git is that it's incremental. Make a small change? Git commit. Label that small change with a brief description in the form of a commit message and be on your way. Building a habit around regular, incremental commits both keeps you familiar with the syntax and makes it easier to revert to earlier versions of your work.
