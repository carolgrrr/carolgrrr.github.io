This is a thing I wish someone had told me when I was first learning to program: 

"Write the smallest program that works."

Say you need to write a program that opens an existing file and performs some computation on the data stored in that file. Well, first write a program that successfully finds that file on your computer. Once you've found it, open it, read it, and print out the data. After each of these incremental steps save your work (in other words, git commit). This is a good habit to build as you start programming.
