All my life I have been afraid of people being mean to me on the internet. It has taken me a long time to admit to myself that this fear truly exists. Now that I am aware, I know that I must exist, publicly, on the internet. At the moment I want to write about code. I'm not exactly sure what I want to say yet, but I know it will be easier to figure out along the way than to be too afraid to even begin. I'm apprehensive about choosing *this* location, but we'll see how it goes.
