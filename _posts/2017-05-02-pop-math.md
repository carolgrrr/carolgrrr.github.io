I watched someone do a computational party trick during a presentation recently. I could tell you about the trick, but it wasn't very interesting. The interesting part of this story is what the guy sitting next to me typed into his iPhone. 

I typed the exact same number into a calculator over 20 years earlier. So I was incredibly amused to glance over my shoulder at a family-friendly event and find a middle-aged man tapping several combinations of numbers, trying to remember how to make a calculator display the word "BOOBIES."

In case you were wondering, it's 8008135.
