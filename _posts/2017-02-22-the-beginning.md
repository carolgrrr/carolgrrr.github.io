At first there is a lot of time feeling stuck. It's not working and it's still not working and you have no idea what question to even ask for help. The first step toward mastery is learning how to ask questions that will allow those who know more than you to help you get unstuck. Step 2 is the same as step 1, except with Google, searching for conversations other people have had about a problem similar enough to yours that you can extrapolate your way to a solution. Eventually what once didn't work now does work and you feel so satisfied.
